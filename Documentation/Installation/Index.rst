Installation
============

As stated in the previous chapter, this extension must be installed using Composer to be able to use the AWS SDK.
From that point on configuration is pretty straight-forward.

Head over to your CLI and run the following command

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require maxserv/fal_s3

This wil take care of installing all dependencies like the AWS SDK and this extension.
After installing it's necessary to flush the system caches.
